== Prepare Systems for Configuration Management [Management]

To manage traditional client configuration with {productname}, the client must have the appropriate tools and the [path]``config-enable`` file installed.
These tools will be available if you installed the system with the configuration management functionality using {ay} or Kickstart.
If not, they can be found in the Tools child channel for your distribution.
Download and install the latest [path]``mgr-cfg*`` packages:

* [path]``mgr-cfg`` -- the base libraries and functions needed by all [path]``mgr-cfg-*`` packages,
* [path]``mgr-cfg-actions`` -- the RPM package required to run configuration actions scheduled via {productname},
* [path]``mgr-cfg-client`` -- the RPM package with a command line interface to the client features of the Configuration Management system,
* [path]``mgr-cfg-management`` -- the RPM package with a command line interface used to manage {productname} configuration.


Installation of these packages can also be accomplished during bootstrapping if you enable [guimenu]``Configuration File Deployment`` on the [guimenu]``Details`` page of the activation key after creating that activation key.
For more information about activation keys, see
xref:reference:systems/activation-keys.adoc#s3-sm-system-keys-manage[].
